some case that will be ignored by this tool:

1 struct __key_reference_with_attributes : fixed
file: include/linux/key.h
reason: this struct is not actually defined, so we can not find the definition

2 files in scripts and tools
scripts and tools are not belong to kernel code, and do analysis is meaningless

3 some macros that need to be analyzed twice : fixed
some macors need to be analyzed twice to be printed, for the performance of analyzing kernel, we ignored them
